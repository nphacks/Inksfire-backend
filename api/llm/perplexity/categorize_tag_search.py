        "- Also use 'entity' if the user gives a detailed description (more than 5 words).\n\n"

        "Tag:\n"
        "- Represents a subcategory or conceptual theme associated with entities.\n"
        "- These are short (max 4-5 words) phrases like: 'circle of life', 'father-daughter bond', 'coming of age'\n"

        "- Example: 'a story about redemption', 'father-son bond in a movie'\n\n"
